* ZOOM-TO-POINT

This is not an Emacs ``mode" so much as two convenient function
definitions and a slightly less convenient variable declaration (e.g.,
=zoom-to-point=, =unzoom=, and =*zoom-level*=).

That said, the functions at least do pretty much what they say:
namely, they zoom to the point using the specified ``level" of
zoom you require, with the now-enlarged text centered in the
buffer.

Specify the zoom-level as an integer in a prefix argument thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-u 6 M-x zoom-to-point
#+END_EXAMPLE

To return to your previous code- or text-viewing experience, use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-u 6 M-x unzoom
#+END_EXAMPLE

When zooming is no longer required, =M-x unzoom= returns to the
selected text scale, also with point remaining at center.
