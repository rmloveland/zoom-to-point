* ZOOM-TO-POINT

This is not an Emacs ``mode" so much as two convenient function
definitions and a slightly less convenient variable declaration (e.g.,
=zoom-to-point=, =unzoom=, and =*default-zoom-level*=).

That said, the functions at least do pretty much what they say:
namely, they zoom towards and away from the point using the specified ``level" of
zoom you require, with the now-larger or -smaller text centered in the
buffer.

Specify the zoom-level in the parameter =*default-zoom-level*=. For now, type

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar *default-zoom-level* 3)
#+END_SRC

into the =*scratch*= buffer and evaluate it.

Then zoom in on whatever you're aimed at with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x zoom-to-point
#+END_EXAMPLE

To return to your previous code- or text-viewing experience, use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x unzoom
#+END_EXAMPLE

This interface is clunky and represents a minimal first working
version. Expect changes, or better yet, contribute some!
