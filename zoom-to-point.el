;;; Commentary:

;;  Exposes a command, `zoom-toggle', which will increase or decrease
;;  the size of the text at point, and a variable,
;;  `*default-zoom-level*', which determines the change in size.

;;; Code:

(defvar *default-zoom-level* 3
  "Defines how much the `zoom-toggle' command will increase the text scale.")

;; This variable is buffer-local, and isn't always initialized; this
;; causes an error.  We initialize it here to avoid causing errors.
;; So far it's worked well.
